- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
<br>- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.

- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
<br>- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
<br>- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
<br>- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
<br>- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
<br><br>
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
<br><br>
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
<h3>Example</h3>
${FullCode(`
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")`)}
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
<h3>Example</h3>
${FullCode(`
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")`)}
