In machine learning (ML), an algorithm is a set of rules or procedures that a computer follows to perform a particular task. In the context of ML, algorithms are used to enable computers to learn patterns and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for the specific task.
<br><br>
There are mainly 3 types of algorithms:
<ol>
   <li><b>Supervised Learning Algorithms:</b> These algorithms learn from labeled training data, where the input data is paired with corresponding output labels. The algorithm generalizes from the training data to make predictions on new, unseen data. Examples include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.   </li>
   <li><b>Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:</b> These algorithms work with unlabeled data, seeking to discover hidden patterns or structures within the data. Clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms are common in unsupervised learning. Examples include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA).</li>
   <li><b>Reinforcement Learning Algorithms:</b> In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments, and it adjusts its strategy to maximize cumulative rewards. Examples include Q-learning and deep reinforcement learning algorithms.</li>
</ol>

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that each input is associated with the corresponding output.
<h5>Example Algorithms:</h5>
<ul>
   <li><b>Linear Regression:</b> Used for predicting a continuous outcome based on one or more input features.   </li>
   <li><b>Decision Trees:</b> Tree-like models used for both classification and regression tasks.   </li>
   <li><b>Support Vector Machines (SVM):</b> Effective for classification tasks, separating data points into different classes using a hyperplane.</li>
   <li>etc</li>
</ul>
<h5>Use Cases:</h5>
<ul>
   <li>Predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc. (Linear Regression).   </li>
   <li>Classifying emails as spam or not spam based on certain features (Decision Trees or SVM).   </li>
</ul>

Unsupervised learning involves training the algorithm on an unlabeled dataset, and its objective is to find hidden patterns or structures within the data.
<h5>Example Algorithms:</h5>
<ul>
   <li>K-Means Clustering: Groups similar data points into clusters based on their features.</li>
   <li>Hierarchical Clustering: Builds a hierarchy of clusters by either merging or splitting existing clusters.</li>
   <li>Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining as much of its original variability as possible.   </li>
   <li>etc</li>
</ul>
<h5>Use Cases:</h5>
<ul>
   <li>Segmenting customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior (K-Means Clustering).   </li>
   <li>Identifying the principal components of a dataset to reduce its dimensionality (PCA).   </li>

Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments, and its goal is to learn a strategy that maximizes cumulative rewards over time.
<h5>Example Algorithms:</h5>
<ul>
   <li>Q-Learning: A model-free reinforcement learning algorithm for learning a policy, which tells an agent what action to take under what circumstances.</li>
   <li>Deep Q Networks (DQN): Combines Q-learning with deep neural networks, allowing for more complex and high-dimensional state spaces.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Use Cases:</h5>
<ul>
   <li>Training a computer program to play and win games (e.g., chess, Go) through trial and error (Q-Learning, DQN).   </li>
   <li>Teaching a robot to navigate through an environment by rewarding it for reaching a goal and penalizing it for collisions (Reinforcement Learning).   </li>

These types of algorithms represent fundamental approaches in machine learning, each addressing different types of problems and scenarios. Depending on the nature of your data and the problem you are trying to solve, you might choose the type of algorithm that best fits your needs.
